  <p>
    Braun & Sullivan was started in 1983 by Richard (Rick) Braun and Christopher (Chris) Sullivan who engaged principally in the business of real estate investment. For the next 38 years, Rick and Chris grew their real estate portfolio under the Braun & Sullivan, LLP business entity by purchasing buildings, selling buildings, and leasing buildings/suites until they sold the business to Rick’s son Jay in 2021, when both Rick & Chris retired. Jay continued to operate the business under the Braun & Sullivan business name until 2025, when the business was rebranded under the True Stone Properties business name to better align the business name with the current owner/business. Continuing with the same principles of keeping expenses low, self-managing the properties, and working with only specific subcontractors who meet our standards of quality of work, True Stone Properties is committed to offering well-maintained commercial real estate properties at reasonable rates for decades to come.
